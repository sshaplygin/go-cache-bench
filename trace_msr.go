// Caffeine simulator's reader for these traces uses, so results here are
// comparable with the ones published from it. The choice is not cosmetic: it
// decides how many distinct keys a trace has and how much reuse a request of a
// given size contributes, so two runs at different block sizes are two
// different workloads and cannot be compared.

// A record carries a byte length that is multiplied out into one access per
// block, so a corrupt or misparsed length is not a skipped row: it is a row
// that can fill the entire workload on its own. At a limit of zero - documented
// as "read the whole file" - a length in the terabytes allocates until the
// process dies, and at a positive limit the first oversized record silently
// consumes the whole request budget, leaving every policy compared on one
// record's block range.

// request these traces contain and far below the point where one row can
// dominate a replay.

// read at offset 7014912 (which is 4096*1712 + 2560) runs into block 1713, and
// counting from the length alone stops at 1712. It would also miss the reuse
// between two requests that touch the same block from different offsets.

// Each record covers Size bytes and therefore stands for as many block
// accesses as fit in it, which is the same trap the ARC layout has: reading
// one record as one access would produce a workload with different length and
// different locality from the one every published result on these traces
// refers to. A 64 KiB read is 128 accesses at the default block size, not one.

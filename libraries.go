// otterLibrary wraps otter v2, the W-TinyLFU implementation this repository
// also ships as a policy arm.
//
// # Why this calls CleanUp
//
// otter admits on the caller's goroutine and evicts on a maintenance pass, so
// under a replay that writes as fast as it can, admission runs far ahead of
// eviction. Measured: 5000 keys written into a cache built with MaximumSize
// 500 left 1916 of them retrievable, and the cache only fell back to 500 once
// maintenance had run.
//
// Left alone, that does not measure otter's policy at capacity 500. It
// measures a cache roughly four times the size every other subject was given,
// and it wins comparisons on that basis alone - which is exactly the sort of
// result that looks like a finding and is an artifact. CleanUp forces the
// pending work through, so the capacity in the table is the capacity being
// compared.
//
// The cost lands in the ns/op column, and it is real: nobody runs otter this
// way in production, where the maintenance pass keeps up because the workload
// is not a tight loop. Read otter's hit rate here as a policy comparison and
// its timing as a floor, not as its throughput.

// after a Set can miss. Set is also admission-gated, and returns false when the
// frequency sketch judges the incoming key less valuable than what is resident,
// in which case the write is dropped entirely. A read-through replay therefore
// measures ristretto as a caller experiences it, which is the point, but its
// hit rate is not directly an eviction-policy comparison.
//
// Calling Wait after every Set would drain the buffers and remove the first
// effect, at a cost that would dominate the timing column and measure something
// nobody runs. maypok86/benchmarks does not call it either, so this matches.
